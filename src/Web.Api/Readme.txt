This Web.Api project was created only to test AddPostsWithMostVotesCommandHandler from swagger

appsettings.Development.json has a "RedditAuth" json object with a clientId and secret.
Secret is empty there.

For development purposes I use "User secrets" and have a secrets.json created, which is not part of source control.
Token to use as secret's value: "secret": "2dzTDwbc4GIPn95R2rmnUwwY2cLIuA"
